# Instructions:

<B>Max value</B>
Write a program called MaxValue.java that finds the maximum value in an array of ints using 4 threads. Your main should be similar as the one in the above-linked SumThread example, though you should construct your array of random numbers instead of increasing numbers. You may assume in your threaded code that the array has at least 4 elements.

<B>Reverse hello</B>
Write a program called ReverseHello.java that creates a thread (let's call it Thread 1). Thread 1 creates another thread (Thread 2); Thread 2 creates Thread 3; and so on, up to Thread 50. Each thread should print "Hello from Thread <num>!", but you should structure your program such that the threads print their greetings in reverse order.
